Building a Flowchart Editor with Clojurescript, Reagent and SVG

The web has come a long way since its early days and it is now possible to build fully fledged applications using modern web technologies.
However for certain UIs HTML and CSS don't provide the best fit, and the origins of HTML as a document markup language shine trough. This is where SVG can shine and enable a more flexible UI design, all while still leveraging a lot of the powerful tooling that has been developed for websites over the recent years, such as React or a Clojurescript wrapper like Reagent.
I will present a flowchart editor #####TODO####### caveats, pitfalls, thoughts behind UI design decisions
