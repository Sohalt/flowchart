Abstract

Building a Flowchart Editor with Clojurescript, Reagent and SVG

The web has come a long way since its early days and it is now possible to build fully fledged applications using modern web technologies.
However for certain UIs HTML and CSS don't provide the best fit, and the origins of HTML as a document markup language shine trough. This is where SVG can shine and enable a more flexible UI design, all while still leveraging a lot of the powerful tooling that has been developed for websites over the recent years, such as React or a Clojurescript wrapper like Reagent.
I will present a flowchart editor built with Clojurescript, Reagent and SVG to hint at what's possible with these technologies and show some caveats and pitfalls to avoid during development.


stuff:

some attributes and events don't work with SVG (or are not implemented yet):
e.g. focusable, onchange, onblur
text layout can be a little cumbersome
foreignObject
reagent variable scope when using (fn […] (let […] (fn […] …))) form
figwheel + cider (spacemacs)
